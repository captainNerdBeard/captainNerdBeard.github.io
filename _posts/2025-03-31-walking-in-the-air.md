>I'm riding in the midnight blue

*I have officially left the highest point of Earth behind me, on the 15th of March I made it pass the summit of Qomolangma and I am now walking on thin air. Time to start thinking in atmospheric terms, rather than mountains and buildings.

## Every Other Day

Holy crap folks. I made it fifty-seven days without any major hiccups. 

That's eight weeks of fitting in four gym visits a week, which usually ends up either as a Mon/Wed/Thu/Sat or a Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat. 
(I just looked at my marvellous spreadsheet, and I've racked up thirty-three visits over 57 days so that tracks!)

### Freedom (to work harder)

So two months down, nine more to go, and according to the planning I am perfectly on track. In fact, two weeks ago I stopped having to slowly increase my weekly floors and I am now stepping at a level that, if maintained, will get me to 20,000 floors by the end of the year. 

440 floors per week will happily see me through the Plan, with a few floors to spare in case I have to miss a visit. An interesting thought is that, now that my weekly goal will remain the same for some months but I will likely still increase in fitness, I actually have an opportunity to get ahead of the curve somewhat, and do more floors than scheduled. The target has shifted, not so much in quantity, as in philosophy: from *"go until you've made it to X floors but don't break yourself"* to *"after X floors, you can do what you like"* - It feels freer, somehow, having opened up space in my workouts. 

Oh before I forget, here's the stats so far:

### March
```
ADDED ELEVATION: 8.88 kilometres

TOTAL TIME: 6 hours, 49 minutes, 4 seconds
TOTAL FLOORS: 1776 (44,400 steps)


AVERAGE STRAIN: 3.8 out of 5
AVERAGE VIBES: 3.5 out of 5

```
### TOTAL
```
CURRENT ELEVATION: 13.79 kilometres above sea level

TOTAL TIME: 10 hours, 42 minutes, 44 seconds
TOTAL FLOORS: 2758 (68,950 steps)


AVERAGE STRAIN: 3.7 out of 5
AVERAGE VIBES: 3.3 out of 5

```

### Tendon-cies
I was being treated by a massage therapist two weeks ago (she's awesome), who managed to demonstrate quite how highly strung my legs are by making my hamstring cramp up thoroughly with barely any manipulation. As I expected, the tendons along my legs are my biggest source of physical stress. I'm now putting more effort into stretching, massaging and relaxing my legs. I hope it helps.
