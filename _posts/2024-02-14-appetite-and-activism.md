> Resistance takes place on many planes. Occasionally it can be dramatic and public, but most of the decisions we are faced with are mundane and private.
> What to eat is a choice that we make several times a day, if we are lucky.
>
> The cumulative choices we make about food have profound implications.
> Food offers us many opportunities to resist the culture of mass marketing and commodification.
>
> Though consumer action can take many creative and powerful forms, we do not have to be reduced to the role of consumers selecting from seductive convenience items.
> We can merge appetite with activism and choose to involve ourselves in food as cocreators.
