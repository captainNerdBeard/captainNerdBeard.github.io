If I had started writing this update two weeks ago, it would have been a completely different post. 

For those of you following along in-depth, I'll stick April's numbers and the running total at the bottom but the numbers are really not what this update it about.

## Nope-tivation

So I've reached the Long Walk section of this challenge: I'm no longer increasing my distance week upon week, my fitness level is up, and now we're just steadily adding a bunch of floor every visit. Three months ago I had figured this would sort of be the easiest part, in a sort of "switch your brain off and just do the thing" kind of way.

![Oof](/assets/img/AprilFloors.jpeg ){: .right width="200"  } 

As it turns out, that's *not at all* the way my brain (or my body) works. Over the last few weeks, I've had to desperately scrape together motivation and determination for more than a few gym visits. I am still doing the floors, but I am **hating** some of these sessions, no joke. Adding to all of this is the fact that I have had to stop taking antihistamines for my hay fever, because they make me feel even more tired, heavy and -frankly- like a sweaty heap of trash.
I knew this was a risk from taking antihistamines in previous years and it would appear that, this year,  I'll be rawdogging the allergy season. Snif.

## Quarter
Even with all the whining and complaining, I'm 25% done! With the May sessions completed so far added to my total, I've just surpassed 25 kilometres. This means I have:
- comfortable left the Troposhere behind and entered the Stratosphere
- made my way to the middle of the Ozone Layer
- have passed the equivalent distance from the bottom of the Mariana Trench to the summit of Mount Everest
- rose above any weather. Clear skies from here on out.
