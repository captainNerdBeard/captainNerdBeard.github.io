That's a good question!

I think it's important to be realistic about my current state of fitness. I'd not really exercised properly since at least October 2024 because, you know, cancer and things. I've managed to keep going to the gym ever so slightly (Thanks, Em!), but in reality my 'routine' such as it was consisted more of "move this thing a bit, now this thing. Excellent, it still bends in the middle." My cardiopulmonary fitness became, and still is, terrible.

Which is why the plan is: _I'll get better at this as we go along._

Twenty thousand floors is not a small amount, but I'm not just dividing them up equally in 47ish parts. We're going to plan to do less than average at the start, and more than average near the end.

It's a marathon, not a sprint!
