# Going to Space, the Hard Way

I'm raising money for Drake Music Scotland, so that they can empower more disabled musicians to change music for good!  
But how will you do that, Bas? (I hear you ask)

Well...

From the 1st of February 2025, I shall be trying to earn your generous donations by *GOING TO SPACE!* 

Alas, I lack Bezos-level funds to build and launch any kind of rocket (plus, they're quite bad for the environment), but you know what isn't bad for the environment, and pretty cheap? Stairs.
So I will get on the stair climbing machine in my local gym as many times as I can muster before the year is out, and by then I will have reached the edge of space, the Kármán line, which is 100 kilometres (20,000 floors) straight up.
That's approximately 500,000 stair steps. Oof.

If you'd like to see me suffer and if you would like to encourage me to do it some more, please go to https://www.justgiving.com/page/stairstospace to donate.

### Wish me luck.
