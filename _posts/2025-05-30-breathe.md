[*Breathe the pressure. Come play my game, I'll test ya*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmHDhAohJlQ)

If, four months ago, you'd have said that I would at one point utter the phrase "I think I can fit some stairs in before I start the cheese." to myself, I'd have laughed.
But here we are, in the most ridiculous timeline where scheduling 45-60 minutes of intense cardio is a part of my daily timetable. And if you do something often enough, it'll just become part of Normal.

Let's look at-

## The Numbers
### May
```
ADDED ELEVATION: 9.63 kilometres

TOTAL TIME: 7 hours, 24 minutes
TOTAL FLOORS: 1926 (48,150 steps)


AVERAGE STRAIN: 4.28 out of 5
AVERAGE VIBES: 2.88 out of 5

```
### TOTAL
```
CURRENT ELEVATION: 33.26 kilometres above sea level

TOTAL TIME: 25 hours, 28 minutes, 56 seconds
TOTAL FLOORS: 6652 (166,300 steps)


AVERAGE STRAIN: 3.91 out of 5
AVERAGE VIBES: 3.18 out of 5

```

So yeah: May was a hard month for Vibes. I had other things scheduled away from home, so I had three fewer gym visits to account for in the monthly total, which made the remaining visits so. fucking. hard. Having to suddenly do 125-150% of what you're used to is something that is all but guaranteed to piss your legs & lungs off.

But it's not all crap and gloom! Last session I managed to make it to my session minimum *in one go* instead of in two or more parts, as I have done before now.

That's a boost I most definitely needed.

Onward and Upward!
